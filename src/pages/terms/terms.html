<h6>No Fix-No Fee</h6>
<ul class="lists">
  <li>
     1. Subject to these terms IPhixx operates a “no fix-no fee” policy towards the repair of your device(s) which means that
    if IPhixx does not repair a device, then you do not pay a charge in relation to the device that has not been repaired. IPhixx
    will have no liability to you if it unable to repair your device(s), as IPhixx cannot guarantee that your device(s) are capable
    of repair.

      <li>2. (b) where the Repair Services include liquid damage repairs; or

      </li>
      <li>3. (c) to any element of the Repair Services which have been completed. For example, if your device requires a screen rebookment
      (completed successfully) and fixing the power button (not completed), the “no fix-no fee” policy would apply to the costs
      of repairing the power button, but you would still be required to pay for the screen repaired.
</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>3. Where IPhixx’s “no fix-no fee” policy applies, IPhixx shall refund any sum previously paid by you to IPhixx (less, the
