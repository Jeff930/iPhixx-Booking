Your Legal Rights
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the links below to find out more about these rights:
You have the right to:
</div>

<ul class="lists">
  <li>• Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a
  copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
</li>
  <li>• Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data
  we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
</li>
  <li>• Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good
  reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you
  have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
  unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not
  always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
  at the time of your request.
</li>
  <li>• Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and
  there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel
  it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal
  data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
  your information which override your rights and freedoms.
</li>
  <li>• Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
  data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful
  but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it
  to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether
  we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
</li>
  <li>• Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have
  chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
  automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract
  with you.
</li>
  <li>• Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect

        OVERVIEW
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
We created this GDPR section on our website to go over what GDPR means for you and the steps we’ve taken to ensure the protection of your data and privacy.
</div>


<div class="parGContent">
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect on 25 May, 2018 and places new obligations on organizations based in the EEA or which hold or process personally identifiable information (PII), PCI DSS GDPR Compliance about EU residents or Outside EEA Areas.
</div>
<h4>
GDPR DATA PROTECTION
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted by the European Union to deepen and harmonize personal data protection regulations. Now in effect as of May 25, 2018, it is a comprehensive and clear set of guidelines that acknowledges that different “flavors” of personal data require different levels of protection. Sensitive data, such as name, image or photo, email, phone number, credit card information etc, are subject to the highest levels of protection. The quantity of data also counts, with companies that regularly collect and process large volumes of personal data having to register with government-appointed Data Protection Authorities.
</div>
<div class="parGContent">
GDPR applies to all companies, no matter where they are based, who collect and process personal data on EU residents. Non-EU companies have to appoint a GDPR representative and will be liable for all fines and sanctions.
</div>

Some of the key requirements of the GDPR are:
<ul class="lists">
  <li><span class="heads">• Consent:</span> Organizations must get consent to collect personal data, with the level of consent varying according to the type
  of personal data being collected.
</li>
  <li><span class="heads">• Data minimization:</span> Responding to years of gratuitous collection of personal data by apps, with no clear purpose in mind,
  the GDPR stipulates that organizations can only collect personal data that is clearly related to a well-defined business
  objective. If an organization gathers personal data for one purpose but then decides it wants to use it for another purposes
  (such as consumer profiling), that could be considered non-compliance.
</li>
  <li><span class="heads">• Individual rights:</span> Another key feature of the GDPR is the very clear rights that it gives data subjects (i.e., the individuals
  whose personal data is being collected) to understand why their data is being collected and how it is being processed. They
  have the right to object, to correct—and they have the right to be erased/forgotten. They also have the right to be notified
  (individually) if their personal data has been breached in a way that could endanger their freedoms and rights.
</li>
</ul>
<div class="parGContent">
We as an organization and company have taken a number of steps to ensure we are fully compliant with our obligations, and have clear policies and processes to respond to customer and partner questions
</div>
<div class="parGContent">
Iphixx has comply to applicable legislation, regulation, statute or order which may apply from time to time relating to the collection, storage and use of Personal Information including (without limitation) the Privacy Act 1988(Cth), the Data Protection Act 1998, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation May 25, 2018 the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, the Data Protection (Processing of Sensitive Personal Data) Order 2000 and comparable laws, as the case may be in the applicable jurisdiction, or any amendments and/or re-enactments thereof. 
</div>
<h4>
SCOPE
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
Passed in 2016, the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the most significant legislative change in European data protection laws since the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), introduced in 1995. The GDPR, which becomes enforceable on May 25, 2018, seeks to strengthen the security and protection of personal data in the EU and serve as a single piece of legislation for all of the EU. It will replace the EU Data Protection Directive and all the local laws relating to it.
</div>
<div class="parGContent">
We support the GDPR and will ensure all Iphixx services comply with its provisions by May 25, 2018. Not only is the GDPR an important step in protecting the fundamental right of privacy for European citizens, it also raises the bar for data protection, security and compliance in the industry.
</div>
<h4>
SUB-PROCESSORS 
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
A current list of the companies Iphixx partners with to process data is available, you can contact us for that information
</div>
<h4>
PRODUCT / SERVICE UPDATES 
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
Our products and services are being updated to help customers comply with the GDPR obligations relating to obtaining and recording consent. Consent check-boxes will be available on or shortly after the GDPR going live on 25 May 2018. Other technology designed to automate data access requests received from guests will be released in the following weeks. 
</div>
<h4>
PRIVACY POLICY 
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
We have updated our privacy policy to ensure it complies with our obligations under the EU GDPR Regulation. You can learn more regarding our collection and use of your personal information on our privacy policy page.
</div>
<h4>
DATA SECURITY POLICY 
</h4>
<div class="parGContent">
Iphixx has always been committed to ensuring we maintain our customers’ and their customers’ data as securely as possible. Details of our Data Security Policy consistent with our obligations under the GDPR is available on our website terms and condition page.
